<h2>Daily Life</h2>
<h3>School</h3>
<p>
  I go to Singapore International School. It's primary school campus is on 23 Nam Long Shan Road, Aberdeen, Hong Kong. My secondary school campus is on 2 Police School Road, Wong Chuk Hang, Hong Kong. I take the school bus to school everyday. It takes around
  15 minutes to get from my home to my school. Sometimes, my mother drives me to school. My school day starts at 8:30. I have recess from 10:00 to 10:20 and have lunch from 12:20 to 13:00. The end of the school day is at 3:00. <br>A picture of my school can be found below.</p>
